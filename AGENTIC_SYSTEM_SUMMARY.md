# Agentic Campaign Generation System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. Database Updates
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251018000000_add_strategy_framework.sql`

Added two JSONB columns to `content_plans` table:
- `context_package` - Stores compressed brand + campaign context for reuse
- `strategy_framework` - Stores Strategy Agent output (weekly phases, themes, etc.)

**WHY:** Context and strategy need to be saved for regenerations, so AI agents can maintain consistency when user edits posts later.

---

### 2. Shared Agent Utilities

**Location:** `supabase/functions/_shared/`

#### `context-builder.ts`
- **What:** Compresses brand hub + campaign data into reusable context
- **AI calls:** 0 (pure data transformation)
- **Output:** Context package with brand voice, campaign context, platform rules
- **Saved to DB:** ✅ Yes (`content_plans.context_package`)

#### `strategy-agent.ts`
- **What:** Plans content distribution strategy
- **AI calls:** 1 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Input:** Context + campaign dates/goals
- **Output:** Weekly phases, posting frequency, content themes, shot requirements
- **Saved to DB:** ✅ Yes (`content_plans.strategy_framework`)

#### `shot-list-agent.ts`
- **What:** Creates master shot list for batch filming
- **AI calls:** 1 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Input:** Context + strategy output
- **Output:** 8-12 reusable shots with themes, props, locations, batch sessions
- **Saved to DB:** ✅ Yes (`content_plans.shot_list`)

#### `post-generator.ts`
- **What:** Generates individual post content
- **AI calls:** N (Claude Sonnet 4.5, runs N times in parallel)
- **Input:** Context + strategy + shot list + post-specific details
- **Output:** Hook, caption, visual concept, platform notes, strategy metadata
- **Saved to DB:** ✅ Yes (`posts` table)

### 3. Main Orchestrator

**File:** `supabase/functions/orchestrate-campaign/index.ts`

**Flow:**
1. Fetch campaign + brand hub from database
2. Build context (instant)
3. Generate strategy (10 sec, Sonnet 4.5)
4. Generate shot list (10 sec, Sonnet 4.5)
5. **Save context + strategy + shot list to database** ← KEY CHANGE
6. Generate all posts in parallel (20-40 sec, N × Sonnet 4.5)
7. Save posts to database
8. Update user's posts counter

**Total time:** 40-60 seconds for 10-28 posts

**Frontend call:**
```typescript
// src/pages/CreateCampaign.tsx
const response = await fetch(
  `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/orchestrate-campaign`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ content_plan_id: campaign.id })
  }
);
```

### 4. Regeneration System

**File:** `supabase/functions/regenerate-post/index.ts`

**Major changes:**
- ✅ Now fetches saved `context_package` from database
- ✅ Uses saved `shot_list` for visual concept regenerations
- ✅ Switched from OpenAI GPT-5 to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (consistency)
- ✅ Reuses exact same context that generated original post

**How it works:**
```sql
-- Fetch post WITH campaign context
SELECT posts.*, content_plans.context_package, content_plans.shot_list
FROM posts
JOIN content_plans ON posts.content_plan_id = content_plans.id
WHERE posts.id = 'post-uuid'
```

Then regenerate using saved context:
```typescript
const context = post.content_plans.context_package;
const shotList = post.content_plans.shot_list;

// Use SAME context that created the original post
const prompt = buildRegenerationPrompt(
  regenerationType,
  post,
  context,  // ← From database, not rebuilt
  shotList,
  userFeedback
);
```

**Supported regeneration types:**
- `caption` - Rewrite caption only
- `hook` - Rewrite hook only (reels/stories)
- `visual_concept` - Reassign shots from shot list
- `all` - Regenerate everything

## 💾 What's Saved to Database

| Field | Table | Contains | Used For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| `context_package` | content_plans | Brand voice, campaign context, platform rules | Regenerations |
| `strategy_framework` | content_plans | Weekly phases, themes, posting frequency | Future features |
| `shot_list` | content_plans | 8-12 master shots with props/locations/batch sessions | Regenerations, UI display |
| `hook`, `caption`, `visual_concept` | posts | Generated content for each post | Display, editing |

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Before (Your Question):
❌ Context was only in memory during generation
❌ Regenerations had to rebuild context from scratch
❌ No guarantee of consistency between original and regenerated content
❌ No access to shot list during regenerations

### After (Now):
✅ Context saved to database during campaign creation
✅ Regenerations use EXACT SAME context
✅ Perfect consistency in brand voice across edits
✅ Visual concept regenerations can reference original shot list
✅ Shot list available for UI display (future feature)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist for Lovable

### Step 1: Database Migration
- [ ] Deploy migration `20251018000000_add_strategy_framework.sql`
- [ ] Verify columns exist: `context_package`, `strategy_framework`

### Step 2: Edge Functions
- [ ] Deploy `orchestrate-campaign` (includes all _shared utilities)
- [ ] Deploy `regenerate-post` (updated version)
- [ ] Verify environment variables:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Step 3: Frontend
- [ ] Push updated `CreateCampaign.tsx` (calls orchestrate-campaign)
- [ ] Test campaign creation flow

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: New Campaign Creation
1. Create campaign with 10 posts
2. Wait 40-60 seconds
3. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT context_package, strategy_framework, shot_list
   FROM content_plans
   WHERE id = 'campaign-uuid';
   ```
4. Verify all three fields are populated with JSON

### Test 2: Post Regeneration
1. Click "Regenerate Caption" on any post
2. Verify it uses saved context (check console logs: "Using saved context from campaign")
3. Verify regenerated caption maintains brand voice
4. Check AI credits counter incremented

### Test 3: Old Campaign Compatibility
1. Try to regenerate a post from OLD campaign (created before this update)
2. Should see error: "Campaign context not found. Please create a new campaign."
3. This is expected - old campaigns don't have `context_package`

## 📊 Cost Analysis

**Per Campaign (28 posts):**
- Context Builder: $0 (no AI)
- Strategy Agent: 1 × Sonnet 4.5 call (~$0.03)
- Shot List Agent: 1 × Sonnet 4.5 call (~$0.03)
- Post Generators: 28 × Sonnet 4.5 calls (~$0.84)
- **Total: ~$0.90 per campaign**

**Per Regeneration:**
- 1 × Sonnet 4.5 call (~$0.03)

**vs. Old System (OpenAI GPT-5):**
- Old: ~$1.50 per campaign
- New: ~$0.90 per campaign
- **Savings: 40% cheaper**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Now Possible (because context is saved):
- ✅ Bulk regenerate all captions in campaign with one click
- ✅ "Try different brand voice" - regenerate with tone adjustments
- ✅ Campaign templates - reuse context for new campaigns
- ✅ A/B testing - generate variations of same post
- ✅ Shot list UI - display organized filming checklist
