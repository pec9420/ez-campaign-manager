## AI Post Type Selection Logic

When generating a content plan, our AI considers:

1. **Campaign Timeline:** More educational early, more promotional late
2. **Important Date:** Heavy promotional focus around this date
3. **Post Mix:** Ensures variety (not 10 promotional posts in a row)
4. **Platform:** Instagram leans more visual engagement, LinkedIn more educational
5. **Brand Voice:** Some brands (e.g., "bold") lean heavier on promotional; others (e.g., "nurturing") lean educational

### Example: 10-Post Content Plan for Product Launch

| Post # | Date | Type | Reasoning |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Day 1 | Educational | Build trust, provide value |
| 2 | Day 3 | Engagement | Spark conversation, boost reach |
| 3 | Day 5 | Educational | Continue authority-building |
| 4 | Day 7 | Behind-the-Scenes | Tease launch, build anticipation |
| 5 | Day 10 | Promotional | Pre-launch offer |
| 6 | Day 12 | Testimonial | Social proof before launch |
| 7 | Day 14 | Promotional | **LAUNCH DAY** (important_date) |
| 8 | Day 16 | Engagement | Post-launch feedback gathering |
| 9 | Day 18 | Testimonial | Show early results |
| 10 | Day 21 | Promotional | Last chance messaging |

## Common Post Type Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Much Promotional Content
**Problem:** Audience tunes out, engagement drops, feels salesy

**Fix:** Follow 60/40 rule (60% value, 40% selling) or 70/30 for newer accounts

### Mistake 2: Educational Posts That Don't Tie Back to Brand
**Problem:** Provide value but don't drive business goals

**Fix:** Subtly connect lesson to product ("This is why we built X to solve Y")

### Mistake 3: Engagement Posts That Are Too Generic
**Problem:** "What's your favorite color?" doesn't drive meaningful conversation

**Fix:** Ask questions specific to target audience's challenges, goals, or experiences

### Mistake 4: Testimonials Without Context
**Problem:** "This product is amazing! - Jane" (Not compelling)

**Fix:** Tell the story‚Äîchallenge, solution, result. Make it specific.

### Mistake 5: Behind-the-Scenes Without Purpose
**Problem:** Sharing for the sake of sharing (e.g., "here's my coffee")

**Fix:** Tie BTS to a lesson, reveal, or authentic struggle that resonates
