# Brand Voice Guide

## What is Brand Voice?

Brand voice is the consistent personality and tone that comes through in all of a business's content. It's how a brand "sounds" when it communicates—whether that's friendly and casual, professional and authoritative, playful and quirky, or any combination of characteristics.

For Plannit AI, capturing and maintaining brand voice is critical because:
1. **Consistency builds trust** - Audiences recognize and connect with familiar voices
2. **Differentiation** - Voice sets a brand apart from competitors
3. **Authenticity** - The right voice attracts the right customers
4. **AI personalization** - Voice guides our AI to generate content that sounds like the actual business owner

## Brand Vibe Words: The Core Input

In the Brand Hub, we ask users for **3-5 brand vibe words**. These words are the foundation for how our AI interprets and generates content.

### Examples of Brand Vibe Words

| Vibe Word | What It Means in Content |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Modern** | Clean, current, forward-thinking language. Avoids outdated phrases. |
| **Playful** | Uses humor, emojis, exclamation points. Not overly serious. |
| **Empowering** | Confidence-building language. "You can do this!" tone. |
| **Luxurious** | Sophisticated vocabulary, aspirational imagery. |
| **Down-to-earth** | Conversational, relatable, no jargon. |
| **Professional** | Polished, formal, expertise-focused. |
| **Rebellious** | Challenges norms, edgy, opinionated. |
| **Warm** | Friendly, welcoming, personal. |
| **Bold** | Strong statements, takes a stance, confident. |
| **Minimalist** | Short sentences, simple language, less is more. |

### How AI Uses Vibe Words

Our AI translates vibe words into specific writing patterns:

**Example: "Modern, Approachable, Empowering"**
- **Modern:** Uses current trends, references recent events, avoids dated phrases
- **Approachable:** Second-person "you", contractions ("you're" not "you are"), casual transitions
- **Empowering:** Positive reinforcement, focuses on capabilities, "imagine what you could..." language

**Generated Caption:**
> You've been putting off your brand photoshoot because it feels overwhelming, right? Here's the thing: you don't need a fancy studio or professional equipment. Your smartphone and a window are enough to create scroll-stopping content. This week, we're breaking down exactly how to DIY your brand photos—no excuses. Ready to finally check this off your list? 📸

**Example: "Luxurious, Sophisticated, Exclusive"**
- **Luxurious:** Elevated vocabulary, sensory descriptions, aspirational positioning
- **Sophisticated:** Longer sentences, refined tone, avoids slang
- **Exclusive:** Creates sense of insider access, curated experience, "you deserve" language

**Generated Caption:**
> Introducing our limited collection—crafted for those who recognize that true luxury lies in the details. Each piece is meticulously designed to elevate your everyday rituals into moments of indulgence. This is not for everyone. This is for you.

## Tone vs. Voice

### Voice = Personality (Consistent)
Voice doesn't change. A brand that's "playful and bold" is always playful and bold.

### Tone = Emotion (Flexible)
Tone adapts to the context of the post. Even a "playful" brand can be serious when announcing something important.

**Example: Playful Brand, Different Tones**

**Educational Post (Helpful Tone):**
> Let's talk about the #1 mistake we see small businesses make on Instagram...

**Promotional Post (Exciting Tone):**
> 🎉 IT'S HERE! The thing you've been asking for is finally live!

**Engagement Post (Curious Tone):**
> Quick poll: Are you a "batch all content on Sunday" person or a "wing it day-of" person? 👀

All three maintain the playful voice (emoji use, casual language) but adjust tone for context.

## Voice by Target Audience

Brand voice should also align with **who they're talking to**.

### Target Audience: Busy Moms
**Voice Characteristics:**
- Empathetic, understanding, no guilt trips
- Practical, solution-focused
- Relatable struggles mentioned
- Time-saving emphasized

**Example Caption:**
> We know bedtime is already chaotic enough without adding a 10-step skincare routine. That's why our cleanser is one-and-done—effective enough to actually work, fast enough to fit into your real life. Because you deserve simple self-care. 💙

### Target Audience: Corporate Professionals
**Voice Characteristics:**
- Polished, authoritative, data-driven
- Respects their expertise
- Focuses on efficiency and ROI
- Professional without being stuffy

**Example Caption:**
> Time is your most valuable asset. That's why our platform is built to eliminate the inefficiencies costing your team hours every week. Streamlined workflows. Data-driven insights. Results that matter. Let's talk about optimization.

### Target Audience: Gen Z Entrepreneurs
**Voice Characteristics:**
- Trend-aware, conversational, no corporate-speak
- Authenticity > perfection
- Community-first language
- Self-aware, sometimes self-deprecating

**Example Caption:**
> Not me thinking I could launch a business and still have a life 😅 If you're out here building something while also trying to, like, eat real meals and sleep occasionally—this one's for you. Let's normalize the messy middle. Drop a 🙋‍♀️ if you're in the trenches rn.

## Common Voice Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. Too Generic
**Problem:** Content sounds like it could be for any business.

**Bad Example:**
> We're excited to announce our new product! Check it out today!

**Good Example (Playful, Bold):**
> Okay, we literally couldn't keep this secret any longer. The thing you've been DMing us about? It's finally here. And it's even better than you thought. Link in bio before we sell out. 🔥

### 2. Inconsistent Voice
**Problem:** Post to post sounds like different people wrote it.

**Example of Inconsistency:**
- Post 1: "Heyyy friends! Who else is obsessed with fall? 🍂"
- Post 2: "Pursuant to our Q3 objectives, we are pleased to present..."

**Fix:** Establish brand vibe words and stick to them across ALL content.

### 3. Not Matching the Audience
**Problem:** Voice doesn't resonate with target customer.

**Bad Example (Luxury brand talking to budget-conscious audience):**
> Indulge in the opulence of our exclusive collection, curated for the discerning connoisseur.

**Good Example (Same brand, adjusted):**
> You work hard. You deserve to treat yourself to something that lasts. Our collection is designed for quality that endures—because investing in yourself is never overrated.

### 4. Trying to Be Everything
**Problem:** Attempting to appeal to everyone ends up appealing to no one.

**Fix:** Pick 3-5 vibe words and commit. Not every brand needs to be "fun and quirky." Some should be "serious and trustworthy."

## How Plannit AI Interprets Voice

### Step 1: User Inputs Brand Vibe Words
User completes Brand Hub:
- Business: "Eco-Friendly Candle Shop"
- Vibe words: ["Earthy", "Calming", "Conscious"]

### Step 2: AI Translates to Writing Style
Our prompts instruct the AI:
- **Earthy:** Use nature metaphors, grounding language, organic descriptions
- **Calming:** Slower pace, softer language, no urgency/pressure
- **Conscious:** Ethical language, sustainability focus, intentional choices

### Step 3: Generated Content Reflects Voice
**Sample Hook:**
> In a world that never slows down, your space should be your sanctuary.

**Sample Caption:**
> We believe the things you bring into your home should be as kind to the planet as they are to your peace of mind. That's why every candle is hand-poured using 100% soy wax, sustainably sourced materials, and fragrances that ground you in the present moment. No harsh chemicals. No compromises. Just clean, conscious comfort. Light one tonight and feel the difference. 🌿

Notice:
- Nature references: "planet", "soy wax", "ground you", "🌿"
- Calming language: "sanctuary", "peace of mind", "present moment"
- Conscious positioning: "sustainably sourced", "no compromises"

## Voice Guardrails

These are the rules our AI follows to maintain voice integrity:

### 1. Always Reference Brand Vibe Words
Every prompt includes: "Maintain the brand voice using these vibe words: [words]"

### 2. Match Target Audience Language
Prompt includes: "Write for this audience: [target customer description]"

### 3. Platform-Appropriate Voice
Instagram allows more casual/emoji-heavy than LinkedIn. Prompts specify platform.

### 4. Regeneration Preserves Voice
Even when users say "make it more engaging," we regenerate while keeping vibe words intact.

---

## Voice by Post Type

Even within one brand, voice can slightly shift based on post type:

### Educational Posts
- More authoritative, expert tone
- Still uses vibe words but focuses on teaching
- Example: "Here's exactly how to..."

### Promotional Posts
- More excitement, urgency
- Leverages vibe words to create desire
- Example: "You're not going to want to miss this..."

### Engagement Posts
- More conversational, community-focused
- Uses vibe words to invite interaction
- Example: "Tell us: how do you...?"

All three maintain the core voice but adjust emphasis.

---

## Testing Voice Consistency

When evaluating generated content, ask:

1. **Does this sound like it came from the same brand?** (Consistency check)
2. **Would the target customer connect with this?** (Audience alignment)
3. **Can I hear the vibe words in the language?** (Voice accuracy)
4. **Does this match the platform's expectations?** (Platform fit)

If any answer is "no," regenerate with more specific instructions.

## Final Takeaway

**Brand voice is not just "how we write"—it's the strategic application of personality to build connection and trust with the right audience.**

Plannit AI's role is to take a user's brand vibe words and target audience, and generate content that sounds authentically like their business—not generic AI content, not corporate jargon, not someone else's voice.

The goal: Every caption should feel like the business owner could have written it themselves if they had the time and expertise.
