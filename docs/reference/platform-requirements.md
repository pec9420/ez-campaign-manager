# Platform Requirements & Best Practices

## Overview

Each social media platform has unique constraints, algorithms, and audience behaviors. Content must be tailored to perform well on each platform—not just copy-pasted across channels.

This guide outlines technical requirements, best practices, and content strategy for each platform Plannit AI supports.

## Instagram

### Technical Requirements

**Caption Length:**
- Max: 2,200 characters
- **Recommended:** 150-300 characters for feed posts (users must click "more" after 125 characters)
- **Reels captions:** 1-2 sentences max (viewers skim fast)

**Hashtags:**
- Max: 30 hashtags per post
- **Recommended:** 3-5 highly relevant hashtags
- **Strategy:** Mix of broad (10K-100K posts), niche (1K-10K posts), and branded hashtags
- **Placement:** In first comment or at end of caption (not mid-caption)

**Image Specs:**
- Square: 1080 x 1080px (1:1 ratio)
- Portrait: 1080 x 1350px (4:5 ratio)
- Landscape: 1080 x 566px (1.91:1 ratio)
- Stories: 1080 x 1920px (9:16 ratio)
- Reels: 1080 x 1920px (9:16 ratio)

**Video Specs:**
- Feed video: Up to 60 seconds (though shorter = better)
- Reels: 15-90 seconds (sweet spot: 15-30 seconds)
- Stories: 15 seconds per story slide

### Content Strategy

**Algorithm Priorities:**
- **Engagement rate** (saves, shares > comments > likes)
- **Watch time** (for Reels—keep them watching to the end)
- **Relevance** (content that sparks conversation)

**Hook Strategy:**
- First line MUST grab attention (appears before "...more")
- Use emojis strategically to break up text
- Ask questions or make bold statements

**Caption Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences, engaging question or statement)
2. **Value** (teach, inspire, or entertain—2-3 paragraphs)
3. **CTA** (ask for comment, save, share, or link in bio)

**Visual Best Practices:**
- Bright, high-contrast images perform better
- Faces in photos increase engagement
- Consistent aesthetic/filter for brand recognition
- Text overlay on images should be minimal and readable

**Post Types That Work:**
- Carousel posts (swipe for value—education-heavy)
- Reels (trending audio, quick tips, behind-the-scenes)
- Story polls, questions, and quizzes (high engagement)

**Timing:**
- Post when target audience is most active (varies by niche)
- General best times: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 5-7pm (local time)

### Example Instagram Post

**Post Type:** Educational  
**Vibe:** Modern, Approachable, Empowering

**Hook:**  
Your Instagram strategy isn't broken. You're just posting at the wrong time. 📅

**Caption:**  
Here's the truth: even the best content flops if your audience isn't online when you post. So how do you find YOUR best posting time?

1. Check Instagram Insights (Business accounts only) → Audience tab → See when your followers are most active  
2. Test different times for 2 weeks and track engagement  
3. Double down on what works

Pro tip: Posting consistently matters more than posting perfectly. Start with 3x/week and build from there.

## Facebook

### Technical Requirements

**Caption Length:**
- Max: 63,206 characters (essentially unlimited)
- **Recommended:** 100-250 words for optimal engagement
- Longer posts work IF they tell a compelling story

**Hashtags:**
- Less effective than Instagram
- **Recommended:** 1-2 relevant hashtags max (or none)

**Image Specs:**
- Shared image: 1200 x 630px (1.91:1 ratio)
- Shared link preview: 1200 x 630px
- Cover photo: 820 x 312px

**Video Specs:**
- Max length: 240 minutes
- **Recommended:** 1-3 minutes for organic reach
- Min width: 600px

### Content Strategy

**Algorithm Priorities:**
- **Meaningful interactions** (comments, shares > reactions)
- **Watch time** (video completion rate)
- **Engagement bait** is penalized (don't say "tag a friend" excessively)

**Hook Strategy:**
- First 2-3 lines are visible before "See more" (make them count)
- Questions perform well ("Have you ever...?", "Can we talk about...?")
- Storytelling > bullet points

**Caption Structure:**
1. **Hook** (relatable scenario or question)
2. **Story/Context** (longer-form narrative, personal anecdote)
3. **Value/Lesson** (what they should take away)
4. **CTA** (encourage comments, shares, or click link)

**Visual Best Practices:**
- Native video outperforms YouTube links (upload directly)
- Live video gets prioritized in algorithm
- Authentic, real photos > stock images

**Post Types That Work:**
- Long-form storytelling posts (personal stories resonate)
- Community questions ("Who else...?")
- Native video (especially live video)
- Shared articles with thoughtful commentary

**Timing:**
- Best times: 9am, 1-3pm (weekdays)
- Weekends: 12-1pm

### Example Facebook Post

**Post Type:** Engagement  
**Vibe:** Warm, Relatable, Community-Focused

**Hook:**  
Can we talk about why small business owners feel like they have to do EVERYTHING themselves?

**Caption:**  
I used to think asking for help meant I was failing. Like, if I couldn't juggle the bookkeeping, the marketing, the customer service, AND the actual work... I wasn't cut out for this.

But here's what I learned: The most successful business owners I know? They delegate. They ask for help. They focus on what they're BEST at and let others handle the rest.

So this is your reminder: You don't have to do it all alone. Hiring help (even part-time) isn't a luxury—it's how you grow without burning out.

**Hashtags:** (none or #smallbusinessowner)

## TikTok

### Technical Requirements

**Caption Length:**
- Max: 2,200 characters
- **Recommended:** 1-2 sentences (viewers focus on video, not caption)
- Use caption to add context, not tell the whole story

**Hashtags:**
- Max: Not specified, but captions max out
- **Recommended:** 3-5 hashtags (mix trending + niche)
- **Strategy:** Include 1 trending hashtag for discovery

**Video Specs:**
- Resolution: 1080 x 1920px (9:16 ratio)
- Length: 15 seconds to 10 minutes
- **Recommended:** 15-30 seconds (completion rate = algorithm boost)
- Max file size: 287.6 MB (iOS), 72 MB (Android)

**Audio:**
- Trending audio = higher reach
- Original audio can go viral if content is compelling

### Content Strategy

**Algorithm Priorities:**
- **Completion rate** (watch to the end = pushed to more people)
- **Rewatches** (looping content performs well)
- **Engagement** (comments, shares, duets, stitches)
- **Trending sounds** (using popular audio increases discovery)

**Hook Strategy:**
- First 1-3 seconds = CRITICAL (must stop scroll)
- Use text overlay for immediate context ("Wait for it...", "This changed everything...")
- Start with movement, surprising visuals, or bold statement

**Caption Structure:**
1. **Context** (What is this video about? Keep it short)
2. **CTA** (optional: "Comment if you relate", "Duet this!")

**Visual Best Practices:**
- Vertical video ONLY (horizontal = instant skip)
- Face-to-camera content performs best
- Fast cuts, quick pacing (attention span = 3 seconds)
- Text overlay to reinforce message
- Jump cuts > long, unedited takes

**Post Types That Work:**
- Trending challenges/dances (with your brand twist)
- "Storytime" (relatable narratives)
- Quick tips ("3 ways to...", "Here's what I learned...")
- Behind-the-scenes (authentic > polished)
- Duets/Stitches (piggybacking on popular content)

**Timing:**
- TikTok algorithm is less time-dependent (good content finds audience anytime)
- Best times: 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-11pm (general)

### Example TikTok Post

**Post Type:** Educational (Quick Tip Format)  
**Vibe:** Energetic, Relatable, Fast-Paced

**Video Concept:**
- Hook (0-3 sec): Text overlay "Stop doing this on Instagram ❌"
- Tip 1 (4-8 sec): Jump cut, new text overlay "Mistake #1: Posting without a caption"
- Tip 2 (9-13 sec): Jump cut, "Mistake #2: Using 30 hashtags"
- Tip 3 (14-18 sec): Jump cut, "Mistake #3: Ignoring your DMs"
- Outro (19-22 sec): "Follow for more social media tips ✅"

**Caption:**  
Which mistake are you guilty of? 👀 #instagramtips #socialmediastrategy #smallbusinesstips

**Audio:**  
Trending upbeat audio (changes frequently—check TikTok trends)

## LinkedIn

### Technical Requirements

**Caption Length:**
- Max: 3,000 characters (or ~1,300 characters before "see more")
- **Recommended:** 150-300 words
- Longer posts work for thought leadership

**Hashtags:**
- **Recommended:** 3-5 relevant hashtags
- More professional than Instagram (avoid overuse)

**Image Specs:**
- Shared image: 1200 x 627px (1.91:1 ratio)
- Personal image: 400 x 400px (square)

**Video Specs:**
- Max length: 10 minutes
- **Recommended:** 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Native video > external links (algorithm boost)

### Content Strategy

**Algorithm Priorities:**
- **Professional relevance** (industry-specific content)
- **Engagement** (thoughtful comments > reactions)
- **Dwell time** (time spent reading post)

**Hook Strategy:**
- Start with a question, bold statement, or counterintuitive take
- Personal stories with professional lessons perform well

**Caption Structure:**
1. **Hook** (attention-grabbing first line)
2. **Context/Story** (personal experience or case study)
3. **Lesson/Insight** (professional takeaway)
4. **CTA** (ask for opinions, share experiences)

**Visual Best Practices:**
- Professional but authentic photos (not overly corporate)
- Infographics and data visualizations perform well
- Carousel posts (LinkedIn calls them "document posts") get high engagement

**Post Types That Work:**
- Thought leadership (industry insights, predictions)
- Case studies (results-driven)
- Career lessons ("What I learned from...")
- Polls (increase engagement and algorithm favor)

**Timing:**
- Best times: 7-9am, 12pm, 5-6pm (weekdays only—weekends are dead)

### Example LinkedIn Post

**Post Type:** Thought Leadership  
**Vibe:** Professional, Insightful, Data-Driven

**Hook:**  
After analyzing 500+ social media campaigns, I've noticed one pattern that separates successful brands from everyone else.

**Caption:**  
It's not budget. It's not follower count. It's consistency.

The brands that show up 3-5x per week, even with imperfect content, outperform those who post sporadically with "perfect" content.

Why? Because algorithms reward consistency. Audiences build habits around consistent creators. And momentum compounds.

Here's what I recommend to every client:
- Post 3x/week minimum (pick specific days)
- Batch-create content (film 1 day, post all week)
- Focus on one platform first (don't spread too thin)

The goal isn't perfection—it's presence.

## Platform-Specific AI Prompt Adjustments

When generating content, Plannit AI adjusts prompts based on platform:

**Instagram Prompt Addition:**
> "Write a visually engaging caption optimized for Instagram. Keep the hook under 125 characters (before '...more'). Use 2-3 emojis strategically. Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end."

**Facebook Prompt Addition:**
> "Write a longer-form caption optimized for Facebook. Lead with a relatable question or personal story. Use paragraph breaks for readability. Focus on sparking meaningful comments."

**TikTok Prompt Addition:**
> "Write a 1-2 sentence caption optimized for TikTok. Keep it punchy and conversational. Describe a 15-30 second video concept that uses trending audio and fast cuts."

**LinkedIn Prompt Addition:**
> "Write a professional caption optimized for LinkedIn. Lead with a bold or counterintuitive hook. Share a lesson or insight. Use paragraph breaks and ask a thought-provoking question at the end."

## Common Platform Mistakes to Avoid

### Instagram
- ❌ Using all 30 hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ Long captions without line breaks (hard to read)
- ❌ Ignoring Stories/Reels (feed posts alone don't reach)

### Facebook
- ❌ Posting external links (algorithm penalizes)
- ❌ Using engagement bait ("Tag a friend to win!")
- ❌ Treating it like Instagram (different audience, different tone)

### TikTok
- ❌ Posting horizontal video (instant scroll-past)
- ❌ Over-polished content (TikTok users value authenticity)
- ❌ Ignoring trends (trending audio = discoverability)

### LinkedIn
- ❌ Being overly salesy (audience wants value, not ads)
- ❌ Posting on weekends (dead zone)
- ❌ Using too many emojis (not the platform for it)

## Final Takeaway

**One size does NOT fit all.** Content must be tailored to each platform's technical requirements, algorithm priorities, and audience expectations.

Plannit AI's job is to generate platform-optimized content that respects these differences—not generic posts that get copy-pasted everywhere.
