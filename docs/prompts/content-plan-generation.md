## User Refinement Prompt

When a user provides feedback to regenerate the entire content plan:

```
The user has requested changes to the content plan:
"{user_feedback}"

Using the original brand context and campaign details, regenerate the {post_limit} posts with these modifications. Maintain the same strategic distribution (educational, promotional, engagement mix) but adjust according to the user's feedback.

Keep the same JSON structure and ensure all posts remain cohesive as a campaign strategy.
```
